This info is gathered and can give valuable\r\n insight as to what type of fish people have been catching and and where they\r\n caught them. You can filter the map if you are interested in a particular area,\r\n and see what type of fish were caught, depth of catch, bait used, time of day\r\n and more. Hopefully future updates will also show current cold spots, so you\r\n don't have to waste a bunch of time fishing where others have already been and aren't\r\n having any luck."

This site was originally designed to track fishing activity in the Oslo Fjord. Oslo fjord is huge, and it can be hard as hell to find where the fish are hiding. Currently, most of the data collected is from there, but the more this application is used in your area, the more information you will have, so tell a friend, and join and start adding your catches."
